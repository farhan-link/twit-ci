A Newly Compiled Complete Code Igniter library giving you twitter oauth authentication and api access.
# DEMO HERE http://projects.linkites.com/twitter/index.php/
*************************************************************
Get Started:
This Code Igniter Library is straight forward, It contain all the Twitter API access depend upon developers need. Initially 
I only implement Sign-In (Authentication). Developer may feel free to use according to their needs.

#STEP 1) Get A CONSUMER KEY , CONSUMER SECRET FROM Twiiter API Console.
#STEP 2) Put these credentials in Twitterauth library (with in package) in application/library/twitterauth/ folder.
#STEP 3) Here on Line number 8 -10, Change the credentials with your own. Also you need to specify CALLBACK_URL.

VOILA THAT'S IT !!!!!!!!!!!!!! :):):):):)

Now Just Load this library LIke ($this->load->library('TwitterAuth');)
And you got it. create two method one for redirecting user to Twitter and one for callback.
